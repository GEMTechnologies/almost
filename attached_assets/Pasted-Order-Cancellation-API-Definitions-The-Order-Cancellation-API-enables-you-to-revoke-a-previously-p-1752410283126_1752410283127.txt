Order Cancellation API
Definitions
The Order Cancellation API enables you to revoke a previously placed order request that remains incomplete on our end. This API facilitates the cancellation of orders that have encountered failures or are pending transactions.

However, there are certain constraints associated with cancelling a prior request:

Cancellation is exclusively supported for failed or pending payments.
A cancellation request can only be submitted once.
Cancellation is not allowed for payments that have already been processed.
You can access our Cancel Order API via the endpoints provided below:
